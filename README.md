# GenZPy ✨

**GenZPy** is a fun, educational programming language with a syntax inspired by modern Gen Z slang.  
If you've ever wanted to tell your variables to *vibe check* or your loops to *keep it 100*,  
this is the language for you. Built on top of Python, it's easy to learn, chaotic by design, and a whole vibe.

> It's not cringe — it's **camp** with a compiler.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗣️ **Readable, Slang-Based Syntax** – Write code that sounds like how you talk.
- 🧠 **Core Programming Concepts** – Supports variables, conditionals (`fr`), loops (`no_cap`), functions (`glow_up`), and more.
- 💾 **Easy Installation** – Install it as a Python package via `pip`.
- 🧩 **Extensible** – Clean interpreter design, easy to add new keywords or modify syntax.

## 📦 Installation

Install GenZPy directly from GitHub (make sure you have Python and Git installed):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/naurjhanvi/genzpy.git
````

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

### 🏃‍♀️ Run a GenZPy File

1. Create a file with a `.gzpy` extension (example: `my_program.gzpy`)
2. Write your GenZPy code:

```py
# my_program.gzpy

glow_up greet(name)
    spill 'wassup ' + name
fin

vibe_check message = greet('fam')
bro_print message
```

3. Run it from your terminal:

```bash
genzpy my_program.gzpy
```

---

### 🧠 Use Inside Python

You can also run GenZPy code from a regular Python script:

```python
from genzpy import run

my_code = '''
vibe_check x = 10
fr x > 5
    bro_print 'it’s giving... facts'
fin
'''

run(my_code)
```
